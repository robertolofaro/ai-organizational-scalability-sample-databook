A book using a real case of a Jupyter Notebook with the analysis of a survey.

An experiment in transitioning to open data and free the approach to report writing done for decades with customers in activities in cultural, organizational, technological change

And sharing ideas about the future of corporate uses of Artificial Intelligence

This e-book is derived from a Jupyter Notebook that I released on 2021-01-06 as part of a “challenge” on Kaggle.com – you can access the original file there https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/ai-organizational-scalability-and-kaggle-survey

If you do not know what I am referring to: a Jupyter Notebok is a way to have (online, on the cloud; or offline, on your computer) a tool that allows to “take notes” that contain executable code (e.g. in Python or R), usually to carry out some computation (e.g. Machine Learning creation and execution of a model) and produce visualizations.

So, why an e-book about what, in the end, is a data-based e-book already online?

The specific “challenge” was to analyze some data from a survey (the annual Kaggle survey between its own community), while providing both a data storytelling, i.e. telling a story via data and, of course, visualizations.

This book extracts the storytelling part (i.e. data, charts) without the programming code, but adding a deeper explanation of the rationale of choices.

As I wrote above, it is “derived from”, not just an e-book version of the Jupyter Notebook.

Also because, if anything, the reverse is true.
